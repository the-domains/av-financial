## Investment Programs

### RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs

The primary difference between these programs is often the tax consequences, marginal tax rates at the time of contribution versus marginal tax rates at the time of withdrawal. In addition to RRSPs and TFSAs, registered retirement income funds should also be considered. These plans are designed to provide retirees with a consistent source of income after they have left the active work force.

### RESPs

With a Registered Education Savings Plan(RESP), you can set money aside and enjoy tax-sheltered growth until your child begins post-secondary studies. Once university starts, payments from the accumulated funds will give your child the freedom to focus on schoolwork.

### RDSP

The Registered Disability Savings Plan is a long-term savings plan to help Canadians with disabilities and their families save for the future. If you have an RDSP, you may also be eligible for grants and bonds to help with your long-term savings.
